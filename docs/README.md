## Bitcoin Dev Kit

The [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) project (originally called Magical Bitcoin ðŸ§™) aims to build a collection of tools and libraries that are designed to be a solid foundation for cross platform Bitcoin wallets, along with a fully working *reference implementation* wallet called Magical Bitcoin.
All BDK components are designed to be lightweight and modular so that they can be adapted for virtually any use-case: from single-sig mobile wallets to multi-billion-dollar cold storage vaults.

<h3>Playground</h3>

As a way of demonstrating the flexibly of this project, a minimalistic command line tool (called `bdk-cli`) is available as a debugging tool in the [`bdk-cli`](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli)
repo. It can be used directly from the browser.

<h3>Descriptors</h3>

One of the original milestones of this project was to provide wallets with "almost magically" support for very complex spending policies, without having to individually translate them into code.
