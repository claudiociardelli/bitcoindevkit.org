# Bitcoin Dev Kit

The [Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK)](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) project (originally called Magical Bitcoin ðŸ§™) aims to build a collection of tools and libraries that are designed to be a solid foundation for cross platform Bitcoin wallets, along with a fully working *reference implementation* wallet called Magical Bitcoin.
All BDK components are designed to be lightweight and modular so that they can be adapted for virtually any use-case: from single-sig mobile wallets to multi-billion-dollar cold storage vaults.

The main long-term goal is to concentrate the development efforts of multiple people and companies into one open source and very well reviewed project, instead of dispersing them over multiple closed/semi-closed or
poorly designed projects.

While some parts of the library are still considered "experimental" (check the docs for more info), the core `Wallet` architecture is now considered stable. We still can't commit to keeping this same exact API forever,
but we are not expecting to do any major breaking change in that area.

If you want to try out the library for your projects, now it's finally a good time to do it! You can start by checking out the ["getting started"](/blog/tags/getting-started/) section in our blog or joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dstn4dQ)
server to chat with us.
